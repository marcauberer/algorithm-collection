# Algorithm Collection by Marc Auberer

Collection for various useful algorithms. The algorithms are implemented in at least one common programming language and the time complexity is calculated for each algorithm as far as this is possible.

## Introduction to pseudocode
In each subfolder for each algorithm is a README file, providing information to the specific algorithm. Besides the actual implementation, there is the pseudocode of each algorithm included in this README. To understand the basic syntax, used for the pseudocode snippets, please take a look at the [pseudocode cheatsheet](https://github.com/marcauberer/algorithm-collection/blob/master/PSEUDOCODE.md).

## Algorithms
